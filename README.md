This repository contains a MATLAB function with an uncommon error and a potential hidden bug. The function `myFunction` throws an error if the input is negative. Additionally, there is a hidden condition in the `someCalculation` function that might lead to unexpected results for large input values and only triggers under specific conditions. The solution provides improved error handling and fixes the hidden bug.
